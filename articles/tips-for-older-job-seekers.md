## Tips for older job seekers

### Show off your accomplishments without risking biased hiring

> Its an unfortunate truth that some employers can be biased (whether they mean to be or not) against older candidates. Luckily, there are a number of ways to help avoid leading to that bias in your resume and cover letter.

**Only add the last 10 or so years of your job history.**
  * The last ten years of your work history are the most pertinent to a new employer anyway, and trying to fit more on a page often limits the amount you can dedicate to education and other achievements.
  * If you've been at the same job for over ten years that's great! Highlight all of the ways you've contributed there and grown within the company.

**Don't add dates to your education history, and avoid distant dates in your achievements.**
  * There's no reason for an employer to need to know when you graduated or got a particular degree or certification.
  * Make your education and achievements pop with strong accomplishment statements so that date becomes even less relevant if you must include them.

**Remember: dates are optional when creating new jobs, education, or achievements. You can delete dates in already created cards like so:**
  1. Click on `My Info` in the header or side bar, or click [here](https://savviest.com/app/events).
  2. Find the card you want to edit in the `Work & Volunteering`, `Education`, or `Achievements & Activities` sections.
  3. Click on the card you want to edit.
  4. Double-click on the date field that you want to remove.
  5. Delete the date.
  6. Click `Save` at the bottom of the popup.
    * **Note:** Edits will not be reflected in already created resumes. Create a new document to see your changes.
