## Cover letter best practices

### Impress and stand out with an engaging cover letter

> Writing a cover letter can be hard. This is your chance to stand out as a great candidate and an interesting, real person who would make the perfect hire.

* First and foremost, shoot for a one page cover letter. Definitely no more, and hopefully no less.
* Make sure you include specifics in your letter about your accomplishments and and successes in your previous positions.
* In addition to what you've done, try to tell a compelling story about what you hope to accomplish and learn in the position for which you're applying.
* Be real. Employers want to know they're hiring a well rounded, interesting person.
* Make sure you score your cover letter using our Cover Letter IQ tool. It will help you with active voice, using the best verbs, and optimizing your letter to a particular job.
* End your letter with a request for next steps and that you're looking forward to the company reaching out. It's professional and shows you're serious about the position.
