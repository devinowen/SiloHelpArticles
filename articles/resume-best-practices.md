## Resume best practices

### What the experts recommend

> There are a lot of opinions out there about what makes a strong resume. We've worked with HR professionals and recruiters from a wide variety of industries to find what matters most.

* Include no less than 3 and no more than 10 accomplishment statements for each job on your resume.
* Use active voice and personal pronouns to show what YOU did at each position.
* Whenever possible, give hard numbers about how you made a difference at a job.
* Don't be afraid to brag! How were you great at your last few jobs?
* Try to fit everything onto a single page if sharing your resume or cover letter as a PDF.
  * You can adjust font sizes and margins to squeeze a bit more in.
  * Remember, if you share your document online you don't need to worry about fitting on one page!
* In general, avoid objective statements in favor of more accomplishments in your work, education, and achievement sections.
