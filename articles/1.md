  * You can only sign up with a particular email once. If you've previously created an account, log back in at [https://savviest.com/login].
  * If you've forgetten your password you can reset it here: [https://savviest.com/forgot-password].
2. If you already have a resume you want to import, click on the "Import Resume" button on the home page: [https://savviest.com]
  * You'll be prompted to import your resume and add any additional information that we can't pull automatically.
  * We currently only support importing from Microsoft Word documents, so if you have a resume in a different format you'll want to convert it to Word first, or use it to copy and paste info into your account after signing up.
