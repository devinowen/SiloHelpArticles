## Tips for students

### How to optimize your education

> Writing resumes without significant work experience can be tough. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can highlight your education, volunteering, and other skills to stand out.

**If you're low on job history, be sure to include any internship or volunteer positions you've had.**
  * These show that you're responsible and have worked in a professional environment.
  * Your Accomplishments at those positions are just as important as at a paid position. Don't skimp on them!

**When creating a resume, select 'Student' from the 'Format' dropdown in the editing toolbar.**
  * This will prioritize your education by moving that section to the top of your resume and publication sections by moving it to the top of your achievements.
  * The 'Student' format will also allow you to display _Relevant Coursework_ by clicking on the toggle at the bottom of the editing window. If you have relevant coursework saved for any of your education events, they'll now be listed.

**Add your relevant coursework to show employers you have experience in similar areas to the job for which you're applying.**
  * Add Relevant Coursework in the 'My Info' section and in the 'Education Tab'. Find the school or education event that you want to add coursework to and click 'Add courses'.
  * Display Relevent Coursework through the steps in the section above.
  * You can remove courses that aren't pertinent for a given job by clicking on the course in your resume and choosing 'Delete' and then 'Delete in Resume'.
